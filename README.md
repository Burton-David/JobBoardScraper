# Job_Board_Scraper

When I started this project, a long time ago...  I had just started my journey towards becoming a data scientist.  
And, my code was mostly copy and paste into something that worked but probably shouldn't have.  

Now, that I am getting into gear and starting a more serious job search I realize that I've created
what might become a sort of valuable tool towards the goal of landing that dream job.  And, I plan to build upon it here.
 here.   

As with any complex problem we need to break it down into reasonably sized sub-problems.  And, because I can't waste the 
time to look for a pattern in all the subproblems before actually begining the project (Since I created it originally a 
long while ago)...I'll just have to address the tasks as they arise.  And I am just listing the task below, until the whole
problem is solved.
